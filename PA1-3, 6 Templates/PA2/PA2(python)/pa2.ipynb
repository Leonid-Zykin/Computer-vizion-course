    "Images geometric transformations imply a spatial change in the location of pixels set with integer coordinates $(x,y)$ to another set with coordinates $(x',y')$, and the pixels intensity doesn't changes. In two-dimensional plane geometric transformations, as a rule, Euclidean space is used $\\mathbf{P}^2$ with an orthonormal Cartesian coordinate system. In this case, the image pixel corresponds to a pair of Cartesian coordinates, which are interpreted as a two-dimensional vector represented by a segment from a point $(0,0)$ to a point $X_i=(x_i,y_i)$. Two-dimensional transformations on a plane can be represented as the points movement corresponding to a pixels plurality.\n",

If homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Due to this the required coordinates number to represent points is always one more than the space dimension $\\mathbf{P}^n$, in which these coordinates are used. For example, to represent a point $X=(x,y)$ on a plane in two-dimensional space $\\mathbf{P}^2$ three coordinates are required $X=(x,y,w)$. Let's illustrate this with the following example:\n",

Its first argument is an image to transform, the second one is the transformation matrix and the third one is a resolution to be used when creating the resulting image. It returns a transformed image as a result. As the image resolution may be changed during the image transformation, this could be accounted and given as a third image parameter.

    "**Perspective mapping** is a mapping, in which straight lines remain straight lines, however, the figure geometry may be distorted, because this mapping generally does not preserve the lines parallelism. The property preserved under this mapping is points *collinearity*: three points lying on one straight line (collinear) remain on one straight line after mapping. Projection mapping can be as *parallel* (scale is changed), and *perspective* (the figure geometry is changed). \n",

It is designed to work either for stitching panoramic photos `cv2.Stitcher_PANORAMA` mode or for stitching scanned images `cv2.Stitcher_SCANS` mode. Working with `Stitcher` object is very simple. First, need to create an object. Then need to create an array of OpenCV images and pass them to the `stitch()` method. It returns a tuple with its status and a stitched image. The status value shows wether the stitching succeeded. In case of success it is equal to `cv2.Stitcher_OK`.\n",
