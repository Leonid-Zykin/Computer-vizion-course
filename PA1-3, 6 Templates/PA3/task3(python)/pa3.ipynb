The noise in the image makes it difficult to process it automatically. The noises have a different nature, and for its successful suppression it is necessary to determine an adequate mathematical model. Let's consider the most common noise models. When using OpenCV noise have to be added manually, however the `skimage` Python toolbox proveides `skimage.util.random_noise()` function wich allows adding noise. We will try both ways."

    "In this median filtering modification in the mask, weights are used (numbers $2, 3$ etc.) to reflect more influence on the filtering result of pixels located closer to the element to be filtered. Each item is added the giver number of times to the array before sorting. Median filtering qualitatively removes impulse noise, and also does not introduce new intensity values in grayscale images. Increasing the size of the window increases the filter noise-canceling ability, but the objects outlines begin to distort.
